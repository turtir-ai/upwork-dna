# About This Project

Upwork DNA is my end-to-end automation stack for finding better freelance opportunities on Upwork.

I designed it to combine:
- data collection (extension-driven),
- scoring and orchestration (FastAPI + rules),
- AI analysis (LLM APPLY/WATCH/SKIP decisions),
- and operational visibility (Streamlit / Web / Electron).

The project reflects how I work: practical automation, measurable decisions, and production-minded iteration.

## Short "About" Text (for GitHub profile)

I build AI automation systems that turn messy workflows into reliable pipelines.

My focus is Python + FastAPI + n8n + RAG + agentic orchestration. I care about practical outcomes: cleaner data flow, better decision quality, and faster execution.

Upwork DNA is one of my flagship builds: a complete intelligence stack for sourcing, analyzing, and prioritizing freelance opportunities with LLM-assisted decisioning.

## Short "About" Text (for Upwork portfolio/reference)

I built Upwork DNA to systematize my own opportunity discovery process.

Instead of manually scanning and guessing, the system collects opportunities, scores fit/freshness, runs AI-based recommendation logic, and surfaces high-priority jobs with reasoning.

This repository demonstrates full-stack execution: extension workflows, backend orchestration, AI analysis, and dashboard operations in one integrated product.
